Code to complete Advent of Code Challenge 2022

This is for a friendly competition and any optimization help is always appreciated (Please explain the code though since I'm am using this as a learning experience). You can also suggest other ways to solve or improve the task listed by the event.

I use Python in VS Code to run the code. I will also store any data that the competition provides in a VS Code Plain Text file as well.

Thank you for your time and help!
